# - Find the QtXdg include and library dirs and define a some macros
#
# The module defines the following variables
#  QTXDG_FOUND         - Set to TRUE if all of the above has been found
#
#  QTXDG_INCLUDE_DIR   - The QtXdg include directory
#
#  QTXDG_INCLUDE_DIRS  - The QtXdg include directory
#
#  QTXDG_LIBRARIES     - The libraries needed to use QtXdg
#
#  QTXDG_USE_FILE      - The variable QTXDG_USE_FILE is set which is the path to a CMake file that
#                        can be included to compile qtxdg applications and libraries. It sets up
#                        the compilation environment for include directories and populates a
#                        QTXDG_LIBRARIES variable.
#
# Typical usage could be something like:
#   find_package(QTXDG REQUIRED)
#   include(${QTXDG_USE_FILE})
#
#   add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
#   target_link_libraries(myexe ${QTXDG_LIBRARIES})
